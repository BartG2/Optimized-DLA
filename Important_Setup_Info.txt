I apologize for the confusion. Let's try a different approach to install raylib on your Ubuntu 22.04.4 system.

First, ensure you're in your home directory:
cd ~
Install the required dependencies:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libx11-dev lib32z1-dev libglfw3-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev
Clone the raylib repository:
git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git raylib
Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd raylib/src
Build and install raylib:
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP
sudo make install RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED
Navigate back to your project directory (replace path_to_your_project with the actual path):
cd path_to_your_project
Now, you can include raylib in your C++ files:
#include "raylib.h"
When compiling your project, link against raylib:
g++ your_file.cpp -o your_program -lraylib
Replace your_file.cpp with the name of your C++ file and your_program with the name you want for your compiled program.



Ensure you're in the raylib/src directory:
cd ~/raylib/src
Clean any previous build artifacts:
make clean
Build the shared library:
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED
Install the shared library:
sudo make install RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED
This should create the shared library libraylib.so.5.0.0 and install it to /usr/local/lib.
